      <h2>October Newsletter</h2>
      <p>Autumn greetings from Perryhill! We hope this newsletter finds you in high spirits as we celebrate the beauty of October and begin to close out our fall harvest season. As our apple season winds down, we want to extend our heartfelt gratitude to all who attended.</p>
      <p>Seeing our friends, neighbors, and new faces at the farm to relish in the crisp autumn air and gather their favorite varieties of apples is an absolute delight every year. We're thrilled to be part of such a warm and vibrant community. Your continued support and enthusiasm make Perryhill Farm a special place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our website and social media, and we look forward to sharing the magic of autumn with you. Wishing you a cozy and joyful October!

        <h2>Pre-Picked Grab Bags $5</h2>
      <p>It's really feeling like apple season now with this weather! Don't want to pick in the rain or in a hurry? We have picked honeycrisp apples for $1/lb and $5 grab bags available in the stand. For U-Pick we have great picking of Honeycrisp and Ida Red. The Jonagold will open by this weekend. For the best and ripest Honeycrisp go farther down the rows away from the parking area.
